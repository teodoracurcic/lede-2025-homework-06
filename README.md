# Homework 5: Working with Pandas

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks completed as part of *Homework 5* for the [LEDE Program](https://ledeprogram.com) at Columbia University. Both notebook focus on practicing core `pandas` skills for data exploration and analysis.

## Notebook 1: Animals

**File:** `01-Animals.ipynb`

This notebook uses a small dataset (`animals.csv`) to answer a series of basic questions using `pandas`. The focus is on foundational operations like:

- Reading CSV files
- Exploring DataFrame structure
- Sorting and filtering
- Grouping and aggregating
- Using tab completion and inline documentation instead of external help
- Creating different visualizations

## Notebook 2: Billionaires

**File:** `02-Billionaires.ipynb`

This notebook analyzes billionaire data from an Excel spreadsheet. It includes more complex queries and visualizations, with tasks like:

- Calculating distributions by country and gender
- Analyzing sources of wealth
- Visualizing relationships between age and net worth
- Building bar charts and scatterplots
- Creating different visualizations

## Skills Practiced

- `pandas` data exploration and transformation
- Reading CSV, Excel and json files
- Grouping, filtering, and sorting
- Visualizing data with `Altair` and `matplotlib`
- Writing clean, readable code in Jupyter notebooks
